Example users to test each type of user are as follows

Type: Admin     Username: Admin     Pw: admin
Type: User      Username: User      Pw: user
Type: Venue     Username: Venue     Pw: venue

There are a couple of sql databases in the submitted file. The first of these is covid_db_backup, which has a backup of our final testing database
The other (covid_web_app) is the basic structure of the database, which only has the three users shown above, meant for a new system.
